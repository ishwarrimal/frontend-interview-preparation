## About

Hi, I am _Ishwar Rimal_ and I maintain this repo. [Read more about me](https://github.com/ishwarrimal).  
I have close to **8 years** of experience in the software industry. I've been working mostly at startups and have recently joined a product-based MNC.

This repo is open to everyone for contribution.

I am looking for a couple of folks to help me maintain this repo. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.
