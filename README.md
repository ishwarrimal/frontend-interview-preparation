## About

Hi, I am _Ishwar Rimal_ and I maintain this repo.
I have close to **8 years** of experience in the software industry. I've been working mostly at startups and have recently joined a product-based MNC.

Recently after giving a few interviews and preparing an interview guide for myself, I thought of making it public for everyone to access and get benefitted, and it's turning out to be useful to a lot of people.

This repo is open to everyone for contribution.

I am looking for a couple of folks to help me maintain this repo. Feel free to reach out if you're interested.

## Some Feedback this repo got
